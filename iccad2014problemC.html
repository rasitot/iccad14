<h2 class="auto-style2">Introduction</h2>
<p class="auto-style2">Design for manufacturability (DFM) is the science
 of characterization, modeling, and optimization of yield in 
semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs). It is a newer field as compared
 to more established VLSI design automation areas such as logic 
synthesis or place&amp;route.; Due to this, not all design models or 
flows are optimal yet. Due also to more stringent manufacturing 
challenges, criteria that has not been important in the past may start 
becoming important at newer technology nodes.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">As circuit optimization requires simultaneous 
considerations of several circuit aspects, improving yield may end up 
with race conditions against criteria such as performance, runtime, or 
layout size. All of these are important in semiconductor IC 
manufacturing and should be accounted for in a DFM flow.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">In the proposed problem, we tackle a traditional 
DFM problem, albeit with new and important metrics. In particular, we 
target fill insertion in VLSI while considering criteria which in the 
past have not been too relevant.</p>

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="auto-style2">Background</h2>
<p class="auto-style2">When a circuit is designed through either manual 
or automated placement and route of polygons that define devices, 
interconnects, or other passive devices, densities of these polygons 
within windows of interest may have a large variation across such 
windows in the rest of the layout. To balance the density of polygons, 
fills are inserted to bring the density of several windows to a uniform 
number which is picked by technology developers to be optimal.</p>
<p class="auto-style2">As an input, your team will receive layouts with 
regions identified for which fills can be inserted. You will be provided
 basic design rules that you have to adhere to. (Violation of these 
rules will result in your submission to fail.)</p>
<p class="auto-style2">The output will be a layout with fills that have 
been optimally inserted into the regions provided. (Insertion of fills 
outside the regions that are identified will result in your submission 
to fail. Abutting these regions is acceptable.)</p>
<p class="auto-style2">To enable a fair comparison, usage of GPU will 
not be permitted. However, multicore processors and systems that contain
 such processors will be permitted. Wall-clock runtime will be used in 
scoring.</p>

 First two columns indicate window location, third column is the no-fill
 density within that window, and the last column shows the linewidth

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<h2 class="auto-style2">Q&amp;A;: </h2>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">What is the definition of each layer and what is the relation among layers?<br></p>
	<font color="red">Layer 1 is at the very bottom. They are ordered by the layer numbers.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">What is the constraint of fill which would be inserted to increase density, like width, height, or shape?<br></p>
	<font color="red">Fill and metal both use the same rules. You can only use rectangular fill.</font>
	</li>	
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Can we use tool to help reading GDS files? or only use c++ code to read?<br></p>
	<font color="red">Yes, any tool, library, etc. can be used.</font>
	</li>	
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">We were wondering how may you estimate the 
window density? we have seen some papers that have different computation
 is there any unified formula? And how do you evaluate "minimize 
variation"?<br></p>
	<font color="red">We will use 20um non-overlapping square windows starting from the lower left corner.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">When I read the GDS file, I know not how to find the regions identified to fill. How do I recognize the regions?<br></p>
	<font color="red">Any area that is covered can be filled. Empty regions cannot be filled.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Can you explain it in detail? Because I think 
the empty regions should be fill and the covered area can not be filled 
(no place to fill). Moreover, the problem C said:" however the 
non-fillable areas in the testcases can be used to estimate these 
statistics for now." So I think the non-fillable area can not be empty 
regions.<br></p>
	<font color="red">The GDS files uploaded shows where you can fill; they
 don't show what original features were. For the latter, only window by 
window statistics will be provided.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">We calculate the density of fillable region (read from s.gds) at window(0,0) at layer 10003, it is 0.953734 (381493600 nm<sup>2</sup> / 400000000 nm<sup>2</sup>).
 And the no-fill density you gave us (in sM3.txt) in that window is 
0.3288304. We are wondering why is that the fillable region area plus 
no-fill region area will exceed total window area.<br></p>
	<font color="red">.txt files for the s testcase seem incorrect; I will update them.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">What is the definition of "linewidth" ? Can you give us an example?<br></p>
	<font color="red"> Smaller width of a rectangle.</font>
	</li>	
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">If we don't have the total number of "lines", how could we calculate the "linewidth average" after we insert dummy fills?<br></p>
	<font color="red">You cannot, but you can find a way to estimate it.</font>
	</li>	
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Are the fillable region (read from GDS file) and
 the original layout already adhere to the design rules? (Meaning the 
boundary of fillable region can fill)<br></p>
	<font color="red">Fills can abut the fillable region boundary.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Do the polygons in input files (s.gds/b.gds) stand for fillable region or original polygons and dummy fills ?<br></p>
	<font color="red">Fillable region.</font>
	</li>	
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">about the first objectives it says "overlap of 
fill with neighboring (top and bottom if exists) layer non-fill 
regions", Does non-fill region mean the original blank region or it 
include the dummy which we had filled?<br></p>
	<font color="red">You should also avoid the fills you inserted.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Do our program read two files that one is GDS file and the other is density information file ? <br></p>
	<font color="red">Yes.</font>
	</li>	
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Our output gds file should be the no-fill region just like the input gds files, or should be the fill region we insert?<br></p>
	<font color="red">Provide the fill you insert.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">About the final upload files, should we only 
upload the binary executive file of our code? What if some tools and 
libraries are used?<br></p>
	<font color="red">Upload everything needed to run your code on the server.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Can we use rectilinear polygons to fill? or only rectangle? If we can, how do we estimate linewidth?<br></p>
	<font color="red">Only rectangles.</font>
	</li>	
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Would you please do me the favor to tell me whether we can use some LP solvers to solve problem C, like cplex? Is it available?<br></p>
	<font color="red">Only open source solvers can be used.</font>
	</li>	
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">About 3rd problem, we have  question about 
linewidth. Based on Q&amp;A;(9) we are told that we cannot c alculate 
linewidth in exact value. However, practically this is no way an issue 
for a layout. That is, average linewidth is easy to obtain from original
 layout. So, may you tell us what are your considerations to not giving 
the exact information? Furthermore, linewidth accounts for 30% total 
score, isn't it too much if we can only estimate it by taking chance, 
and by no means can we know whether our estimation is close?<br></p>
	<font color="red">We will either provide more information about the layout, provide an estimation method, or remove this metric going forward.</font>
	</li>	
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">We are confused about one constraint: minimum 
metal width and space are 32nm, minimum metal area is 4800nm^2. Are all 
fills should follow this constraint, too? Can the constraint be 
considered as " minimum fill width and space are 32nm, minimum fill area
 is 4800nm^2."  ? Or fills are not necessary to follow this constraint.<br></p>
	<font color="red">Yes, fills also have to follow the same rules; fills are metal, too. Your example is correct.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">I have opened my GDS output in a layout 
viewer,but I did not find any DRC violations. Would you please tell me 
which DRC violation do we have?<br></p>
	<font color="red">There was a mistake in my DRC script that caught the min area rectangles by mistake. You are indeed DRC clean.</font>
	</li>	
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">What does "db precision error" mean?<br></p>
	<font color="red">Here is the exact error message; perhaps you can 
figure a solution if you recognize this value: ERROR: Rule file 
precision 1000 is not consistent with database precision 999.999952503 
in input file DB is database. There is a default minimum dimension 
defined in each layout. Somehow when you have passed your layout 
features through various operations, this value has changed. Perhaps you
 can try to open your text layout on a very small example and see if the
 input and output ASCII layouts have a different parameter. You may be 
able to find such definition at the very top or bottom of your layout 
ASCII file. You may want to consider using a different GDS translator, 
too.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">As the release of the result of alpha test, will
 there be any explicit cost metric given? For example, there are 4 
objectives for variation - std, diff, dev from chip mean and dev from 
row-based. Will they be weighted or just added up? And is the final 
score "a*performance+b*variation+c*runtime+d*size"? If so, will the 
weight be given?<br></p>
	<font color="red">Unless the ratios specified in the website now, 
everything will have equal weight. This means every factor gets 
normalized first.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">In Objective 2, we need to minimize 
variation,which is consist of many items. Can you tell us how do you 
calculate the variation into that single fraction in alpha test results?<br></p>
	<font color="red">For now, it was only the standard deviation of density.</font>
	</li>	
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">For each layer metal, is there a fixed type for 
dummy metals to choose? For example, there are three type (i.e. 
(width,length):(2,3)、(3,4)、(4,5))dummy metal pool to insert in layer 2, 
so I only can choose these three type to insert. If there isn't any 
constraint for dummy metal, we consider that we can insert any width or 
length of metal into fillable reigon. From problem description, we only 
know the lower bound for metal width is 32nm. We wonder that the dummy 
metal width should be fixed for each layer, and the length of dummy 
metals can be different. The length decides the final area of inserted 
dummy metal.<br></p>
	<font color="red">Width need not be fixed. Any aspect ratio is OK.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Is there any fixed placement way for dummy metal
 in each layer? For example, any inserted dummy metal in layer 1 only 
can be placed by horizontal or vertical direction? <br></p>
	<font color="red">No such rule in this contest.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">We still confused the description, "overlap of 
fill with neighboring (top and bottom if exists) layer non-fill 
regions." and the answer of Q&amp;A; #12. We wonder that the more 
overlaps happened, the worse the performance is. And what is the overlap
 definition?  From the answer of Q&amp;A; #12, you mean we should insert
 the dummy metal which won't overlap the fillable reigon which is on top
 or bottom layer? <br></p>
	<font color="red">Your tool should minimize overlap of fills with non-filleable region and other fills you insert in neighboring layers.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Are input’s GDS files only testcase s and testcase b provided on the website during Final Evaluation? <br></p>
	<font color="red">There may be one ore more secret testcases.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">About Alpha Test Results of this time, what is the unit of runtime and size? <br></p>
	<font color="red">Seconds and Bytes respectively.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Q: Dose the objective"minimize the linewidth average difference" mean against the whole layout or each window?<br></p>
	<font color="red">We have removed the linewidth optimization from the objectives.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Q: How to calculate line deviation? I don’t know what column-based average is.<br></p>
	<font color="red">The column of windows within which you are computing 
the deviation of a given window. The column of windows is a vertical 
slab of layout area where the width is defined by the window for which 
you are computing this metric. </font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Q: In the latest revision, if we use parallel 
programming, how would runtime be calculated? second * #CPU or just 
overall runtime?<br></p>
	<font color="red">We are working on a method to account for number of 
cores and maximum memory utilized. We will penalize these if we 
implement the monitoring system on time. Otherwise, we will go by 
runtime only. Number of cores would likely have a log dependency, i.e., 
runtime would be divided by log(#cores).</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Q: How did you calculate "performance degrade" based on total area and overlap area?<br></p>
	<font color="red">We merge your fill results with original layout. Then
 take area overlaps between layers (1,2) and (2,3). We add the overlap 
area. There is no way you can compute the exact output as you do not 
have access to original layouts.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Q: How did you calculate both "line hotspot" and
 "outlier hotspot"? Is "hotspot" a statistically well defined word? If 
so, sorry for our inadequate understanding, yet may you please define 
them explicitly?<br></p>
	<font color="red">Hotspot is a layout area (window) selected based on a
 metric. The selection is made if the metric is beyond a certain 
threshold. A hotspot may have a score associated with it; such score may
 indicate severity with respect to the threshold.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Q: Do you calculate the variation by this 
formula: sqr_root( sum( (window.density - chip mean)^2 ) / window_num)? 
Because our own calculation is quite different from the result released.<br></p>
	<font color="red">It is "chip layer mean." Each layer is added at the end.</font>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Q:  By Q&amp;A;(32), do you mean that the 
"performance degrade" is only taking overlaps between (1,2) and (2,3) 
into consideration? How about total fill area?<br></p>
	<font color="red">Beta submission only checked the overlap but final 
submission will also check area. Area will impact 5% and overlap will be
 15% of total score.</font>
	</li>	
	<li>
	<p class="auto-style2">Q:  Do the ASCII data files M1, M2, and M3 
correspond to the lowest layer to highest layer (10001 -&gt; 10003) or 
correspond to the descriptively ordered layer (10002/10001/10003) in gds
 file?<br></p>
	<font color="red"> Lowest to highest.</font>
	</li>

<h2 class="auto-style1"><a name="lithography"></a>6. Lithography Simulator</h2> 
<p class="auto-style2"><a href="lithosim.tar.gz">lithosim.tar.gz</a><br>

<p class="auto-style2">The standalone lithography simulator for this contest is now released! Below are the details.<br></p>
<p class="auto-style2"><b><u>Basics:</u></b><br></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The lithography simulator uses industrial optical models for the M1 layer and a constrant threshold resist model, with a normalized intensity threshold of 0.225. The input to the simulator has to be a GULP file (similar to the toy benchmark). The input layer <u>MUST</u> be called “M1OPC” (note this, because it can only use the models if this layer name matches). The output will be a text file with a set of 0s and 1s. The 1s correspond to the contours. I have also added some PNG output (check the “Dump” directory) to make viewing of contours easy).<br>
Please note that any input layout is shifted by 512 pixels in both x and y directions in order to account for environment. The output text file is also in this form. Be sure to remove the 512 pixels from x and y axes when you read back the text file.<br>
Currently, the simulator only supports a single tile of 1024x1024 pixels. So you can test and build your system on small testcases (&lt;1umx1um). In the next week or so, I will release a simulator which can handle multiple tiles and hence larger layouts.
</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><b><u>Setup:</u></b><br></p>
<p class="auto-style2">I have compiled on a Linux machine, and would recommend you do the same. If you need to use other platforms and are unable to compile, please e-mail me with details and I can try to help.</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="auto-style2">Download the tarball from the website (<a href="lithosim_v4.tar.gz">lithosim_v4.tar.gz</a>)</p></li>
<li><p class="auto-style2">Extract it – you should see a folder called lithosim</p></li>
<li><p class="auto-style2">In the directory, use “<i>make</i>” to create the executable “<i>lithosim.exe</i>”
<ol>
<li><p class="auto-style2">Ignore any warnings related to “lodepng” in this step</p></li>
<li><p class="auto-style2">There should be no other dependencies. I have tried to ensure that no other package will be necessary for compilation</p></li>
<li><p class="auto-style2">If compilation is unsuccessful, contact me with details of the OS and compilation errors</p></li>
</ol>
<li><p class="auto-style2">Use the executable as follows:</p>
<pre>lithosim.exe &lt;inputfile.glp&gt; &lt;outputfile.txt&gt;</pre></li>
</ol>
<p class="auto-style2">I have provided a sample input file in the “Benchmarks” directory called “m1_straightlines_OPC.glp”. You may use this to start testing. It should take approximately 2 minutes for a simulation on this layer.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><b><u>Thoughts:</u></b><br></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The output format is rather rudimentary. If any contestant has a better suggestion on how they would like the output, please email me and I will consider it.<br>
Given the time it takes to run one iteration of lithography simulation, contestants should consider a mask optimization algorithm that converges in the fewest iterations.<br>
More benchmarks are on the way!<br>
Have fun playing with this lithography simulator and watching your contours magically develop as your algorithm improves!<br>
Good luck!</p>

<!--
<h2 class="auto-style1"><a name="simulator"></a>7. Standalone process variability band (PV Band) simulator</h2>
<p class="auto-style2">The standalone process variability band (PV Band) simulator for this contest is now released! Below are the details.<br></p>
<p class="auto-style2"><b><u>Basics:</u></b><br></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The process variability (PV) band simulator is very similar to the lithography simulator provided. It uses two simulations (i) at nominal focus and +2% dose, (ii) at defocus and -2% dose. It then takes the two contours formed, performs an XOR which generates the PV Bands. The input to the simulator has to be a GULP file (similar to the toy benchmark). The input layer <u>MUST</u> be called “M1OPC” (note this, because it can only use the models if this layer name matches). The output will be a text file with just a single line of output corresponding to the PV Band area in square nanometers.<br>
Please note that the <u>lithography simulator</u> source code is free for all contestants to modify, but the PV Band simulation code will be used as is, with <u>NO</u> modification, in order to test the final mask solutions.<br>
Also note that the Debug folder will contain PNG files relating to the mask and the PV bands, for you to visualize your PV band outputs.
</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><b><u>Setup:</u></b><br></p>
<p class="auto-style2">I have compiled on a Linux machine, and would recommend you do the same. If you need to use other platforms and are unable to compile, please e-mail me with details and I can try to help.</p>
<ol>
<li><p class="auto-style2">Download the tarball from the website (<a href="pvbandsim_v4_1.tar.gz">pvbandsim_v4_1.tar.gz</a>)</p></li>
<li><p class="auto-style2">Extract it – you should see a folder called “pvbandsim”</p></li>
<li><p class="auto-style2">In the directory, use “<i>make</i>” to create the executable “<i>pvbandsim.exe</i>”

<li><p class="auto-style2">Use the executable as follows:</p>
<pre>pvbandsim.exe &lt;inputfile.glp&gt; &lt;outputfile.txt&gt;</pre></li>
</ol>
<p class="auto-style2">I have provided a second sample input file in the “Benchmarks” directory called “m1U2_OPC.glp”. You may use this as an additional OPC testcase to the existing “m1_straightlines_OPC.glp” file. It should take approximately 3-4 minutes for a PV band simulation on this layout.</p>
<p class="auto-style2"><b><u>Thoughts:</u></b><br></p>
<p class="auto-style2">The PV Band simulation time for each of your mask solutions will not be considered as part of your runtime. I will be taking your final generated mask solution and running it through this simulator at my end to measure the area. The code has been released for you to help optimize your mask solutions.<br>
Good luck!</p>
-->

<!----------------------------------------------------------------------------->
<!--
<h2 class="auto-style1">8. Scoring Rules</h2>
<p class="auto-style2"><b><u>Scoring Rules:</u></b><br></p>
<p class="auto-style2">Each final submission will be evaluated, as mentioned before, on the runtime as well as the PV band area. The main emphasis of this contest is to enable a 'smart' mask optimization solution that will converge to a mask solution in the fewest iterations possible, and not necessarily on parallel programming. Although GPU-based solutions will be accepted, the runtime will be scaled to enable fair comparisons with single CPU solutions. Based on the above, the formula for calculating score has been set as:</p>
<p class="auto-style2">
<pre><i>Score</i> = <i>Sum</i>(<i>Runtime</i>*(<i>nprocs-1</i>) + <i>4*PVBand_Area</i>)</pre>
</p>
<p class="auto-style2">
Where,<br>
<i>Runtime </i>= Total runtime to generate final mask solution measured in milliseconds<br>
<i>nprocs </i>= Number of processors used by mask optimization program<br>
<i>PVBand_Area </i>= Area of process variability band as determined by the PV Band simulator provided<br>
<i>Sum </i>= Will be performed across the testcases<br>
</p>

<h2 class="auto-style1">9. Problem C Alpha Submission Details</h2>
<p class="auto-style2">Due to questions from a number of contestants, here is a clarification of what you will need to submit for Alpha. We will require a tarball (.tar.gz file) containing the following:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">All your <b>source code</b> without any external dependencies on other libraries. This may be in C or C++. We are not accepting submissions in any other language.</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">A <b>Makefile</b>, that can be called with <b>make</b> to call the compilation and building to generate the executable (note that we ask for all the source code and Makefile because compilation on one system is not necessarily compatible with other systems).</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">The executable file MUST be named <b>"maskoptimizer.exe"</b>.</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">The executable file must accept, as input on the command line:<br>
	(a) The name of the input layout in GULP<br>
	(b) The name of the output layout, also in GULP<br>
	e.g. <b>maskoptimizer.exe /full/path/m1opc_input.glp /full/path/m1opc_mask.glp</b></p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">No other inputs will be provided on the command line.</p></li>

<!--
<h2 class="auto-style1"><a name="clarifications"></a>10. Few more clarifications</h2>
<ol>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">The <b>lithosim</b> package has been provided to give you access to the models which are being used for simulation, and to help you build your code around it. Feel free to modify this package as you deem necessary.</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">The <b>pvbandsim</b> package is the one that will be used for evaluation. You should NOT modify this package in anyway. Simply use the output pvband area from this evaluator to guide any modifications to your algorithm. Remember that mask optimization is a non-convex problem, so there is no 'golden' answer -- only the best solution you can come up with in a reasonable runtime.</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">For GPU users, I have access to an Nvidia machine with CUDA drivers, 2.6GHz, 4GB RAM and quad-core processors. If you need any other specs from the machine, please email me. I will use the same machine or one with similar specs to run the CPU-based submissions as well. Remember that the runtime for GPU-based submissions will be scaled up since the purpose of this contest is to look at smart algorithms that converge fast.</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">EPE Measurement -- some of you have asked exactly how and where the edge placement error (EPE) will be measured. I have proposed a limit of 15nm (=15 pixels) for the EPE. I am attaching a document outlining where exactly the EPE measurements will be made. You will notice that I am not enforcing this EPE measurement for short corners. This is because in lithography, we allow corners to round and violate some amount of EPE (as long as no electrical violations are caused).</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">Unseen testcases -- remember that the testcases I have provided are not a complete set of benchmarks. I will be using 2 unseen testcases to see how well your mask optimization algorithm generalizes to something that it was not trained on</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">Runtime -- Many of you have asked if Runtime*(n-1) expression in the cost function is valid for n=1. The answer is no. For n=1, the cost function will be:</p>
	<pre><i>C</i> = <i>Runtime</i> + 4*<i>PVBand_Area</i></pre>
	<p class="auto-style2">Also, having run the alpha submissions and judged the runtime on my evaluation machine, I am going to fix the unit of runtime at seconds (and not milliseconds as stated before).</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">PVBandSim package -- I am also releasing an updated version of the "pvbandsim" package, which will be used for evaluation of PV Band area. In the previous release, I had failed to notice that it was using attenuated mask for simulation, whereas we are working with binary masks. I have moved to correct this error in the new release. Thank you to the contestant who pointed this mistake out. Usage is same as before.</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">A few of you have asked me what happens if EPE criterion is not met. I am therefore adding a term to the cost function to address this. Essentially there will be an added penalty based on the number of EPE violations. So you are still free to have some EPE violations, but note that your cost will be higher. You already have the details of where EPE will be measured. I am working to provide you an EPE evaluator which can be used to determine the number of violations in any given solution, stay tuned for that. Here is the updated cost function:</p>
	<pre><b>Score = Sum(Runtime*(nprocs-1) + 4*PVBand_Area + 5000*{Number of EPE Violations}), if nprocs > 1
      = Sum(Runtime + 4*PVBand_Area + 5000*{Number of EPE Violations}), if nprocs = 1</b></pre>
	<p class="auto-style2">Note:</p>
	<ol><li><p class="auto-style2">Runtime to generate final mask solution measured in seconds</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">PV Band area measured in sq. nm.</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">EPE violation occurs when distance between target edge and contour >15nm (pixels)</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">nprocs is the number of processors being used by your code</p></li></ol>
	</li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">Based on alpha submission, I notice that no one has GPU-based implementation. I am therefore closing out any GPU-based submissions. You are, however, absolutely welcome to pursue OpenMP based parallelized applications. In the machine specs below, I have specified the number of cores.</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">I have received some concerns about submitting source code. Let me move to clarify. I will accept a binary/executable as submission provided it runs on my machine settings (provided below). For alpha, I had to work with most of you who submitted binaries because they did not meet that criterion.<br><br>

	<a name="EPE_Checker"></a>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">I am releasing an EPE checker tool. A big word of thanks to the contestant who has provided their code to act as an EPE checker. Download the attached tarball "<a href="EPE_checker_v4.tar.gz">EPE_checker_v4.tar.gz</a>" and extract into a directory of your choice. Please ensure that your lithosim executable is in the same directory. The usage of this tool is as follows:<br><br>
	./EPEchecker.exe [input_layout.glp]  [optimized_mask.glp] result.txt<br>
	[search_bound]<br><br>
	The input_layout.glp will be the testcase being analyzed. The optimized_mask.glp file will be the result of your mask optimization tool when run on this testcase. The result.txt  file will dump a summary of the EPE violations. The parameter "search_bound" specifies the maximum distance to search till when determining EPE. For the purpose of testing, you should check out to a distance of 30 pixels, and EPE violation is flagged if EPE > 15 pixels. A file called "ViolationPoints.csv" should also be produced in the same directory which will have the locations of the EPE violations.<br><br>
	If you have not already implemented your own EPE checks, I hope you will find this tool useful. Please let me know if you notice any issues.</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">I have also updated the definition of EPE to make it more clear. Please find this updated definition in the attached Word document. To summarize:<br>
	Update #1: The EPE checks have been relaxed to be at 40nm intervals, instead of 20nm intervals. This means you have to satisfy EPE constraints at fewer points. This should make things easier for you.<br>
	Update #2: You will notice is that we will check for holes and lagoon in the solution. I fully expect that none of your are making mask optimization solutions that produce holes in the wires. However, I will be visually inspecting the nominal contour from your final mask solution to inspect this. We will impose a penalty for any holes in the contour (see updated cost function below), tagged as "ShapeViol". This is necessary because such holes will not be captured by the EPE spec. Remember that this check is only on the nominal contour -- you may have pinching or bridging showing up on your PV bands and that is acceptable (at some penalty to your PV BAnd area) -- the purpose of this contest is to find a good mask solution, but not necessary that every set of shapes will always have a robust solution.
	</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">Also note that for Runtime, I take the "wall time" in seconds. In previous iterations, I may have been confusing by calling it "CPU time". Please let me know if any of you are pursuing multi-core solutions for this problem.

<h2 class="auto-style1">11. How to Measure Edge Placement Error</h2>
<p class="auto-style2">As you probably already know by now, edge placement error (EPE) is the geometric displacement of the contour from the target edge of the polygon, as shown in the figure below.</p>
<img alt="edge placement error (EPE)" width="869" height="423" src="epe.png" />
<p class="auto-style2">Below are the simple rules I will use to determine the locations to measure EPE. Remember that your constraint on EPE is &lt;=15nm. Hence you will have to ensure that this constraint is met at the locations specified by this set of rules:</p>
<ol>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">Every polygon will be processed edge by edge</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">EPE is always measured perpendicular to the edge i.e. Manhattan distance.</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">For a given edge, if edge length &gt;=80nm (80 pixels), then EPE is measured at the center of the edge only</p></li>
	<li><p class="auto-style2">If edge length >80nm, then start measurement xstart is made 30nm from the first vertex, end measurement xend is made 30nm in from the second vertex. Each subsequent measurement is made 20nm inward from the previous measurement locations and the new measurement location is recorded i.e. after the ith iteration xstart,i = xstart shifted inward by i*20nm, xend,i = xend shifted inward by i*20nm until xstart,i and xend,i cross each other.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="auto-style2">An illustration is provided below, where the EPE measurement points are shown as crosses.</p>
